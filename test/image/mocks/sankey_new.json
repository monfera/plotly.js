The automatic flight control system commanded the aircraft to nose-dive immediately after takeoff because of erroneous inputs from the tri-axis rate gyro. Investigators concluded the accident was caused by the incorrect installation of the tri-axis rate gyro. The drone was being used as a target for a surface-to-air missile test.",

Firefighters allowed the blaze to burn for 26 hours until it extinguished itself. Investigators blamed the navigation system but also concluded that the pilot ordered the drone to climb too rapidly. The pilot told investigators he saw the drone as it \"leaped off the ground\" and thought to himself that \"this is not a good thing.\" ",

Airborne searchers found the wreckage the next day near the Afghan village of Sinkay. Investigators said the cause was a catastrophic electrical system failure, most likely because of a short circuit. Only a complete electrical failure could account for a lost link, the loss of the transponder signal and the inability of the aircraft to perform its preprogrammed lost-link emergency mission, according to the report. The pilot testified that lost links are not uncommon with Predators but usually only last for a few seconds or minutes. \"After doing this for a while, you sort of see this; it's a reoccurring thing,\" he testified. \"I'd say after the 3- to 5-minute period you sort of get the feeling that the plane just stopped talking to us and we may not recover this one.\"",
                      "A Hunter crashed after losing link and making an earlier-than-expected nighttime landing at a military airstrip. While turning during the descent, the aircraft lost its data links and flew out of control about 200 feet above ground level, according to an Army safety report. The Hunter crashed on the runway with its left wing and nose pointing down. According to the mission commander, the aircraft started having data link problems when it was about 30 miles away from the base. ",
                      "A Reaper on a training mission crashed into desert terrain a minute after takeoff because of an engine malfunction. Investigators determined that a vacuum line to the carburetors became disconnected. The flight was the first for the Predator since its old engine had been replaced with a rebuilt model five days earlier. Investigators determined that the vacuum line had been installed correctly but that it was too short and subject to chafing. The pilot's skillful emergency landing saved the aircraft from being a total loss.",
                      "An armed Predator rolled uncontrollably and crashed in an uninhabited area two hours into a mission. Investigators determined that a software chip on the right wing's control module came loose, likely due to vibrations, locking the right aileron into a fixed position. The chip was attached to the control module with a silicone adhesive but did not appear to bond properly. The mission operator testified that this Predator often broke down: \"It seemed like whenever there was an issue on a plane, that this was the tail number.\" He agreed with investigators' description of the Predator as \"just kind of a little possessed aircraft.\"",
                      "An armed Predator mysteriously vanished in Afghanistan about 5 hours into a flight. The skies were clear and the aircraft was flying well above a mountain range when the return satellite data link was lost to Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. The transponder signal was lost three minutes later. Investigators concluded that there was no evidence of bad weather, icing, fuel loss or pilot error. A sergeant raised the possibility that the aircraft could have had its satellite links hacked or hijacked, saying: \"If somebody else was on the same frequencies, they could have taken over the aircraft or just knocked it out completely.\" Investigators found no evidence of hacking.",

                      "An armed Predator crashed in a remote area 10 hours into flight after the engine lost power and the aircraft went into a stall. The camera operator testified that the crew had just started to follow a target -- a suspect in a car -- when \"the plane did something weird.\" Investigators determined that the propeller quill shaft failed due to cracks left during the manufacturing process. The quill shaft eventually sheared apart after the cracks widened from normal wear and tear, according to the Air Force report. A report from General Atomics disclosed that another Predator was affected by a similar quill shaft failure recently, but the details were redacted.",

A crew member reported that the camera showed the fuel \"just spewing out, it looked like Niagara Falls coming over the front of the aircraft.\" The aircraft glided over a populated area but failed to return to base. The crew released the parachute when the aircraft descended to 2,000 feet, but it was too late. \"They would have popped the chute earlier but didn't want to have a parachute being deployed over the city, and this was a concern here,\" the mission commander reported.",
                      "An armed Predator crashed into a mountain after the propeller failed 15 hours into a flight. The aircraft dropped 16,300 feet in about three minutes. Investigators attributed the cause to a failed variable pitch propeller servo, a common problem in Predators. Investigators suggested that \"it would be reasonable to conclude that there may be a flaw in the part's design or accepted refurbishment process.\" Investigators noted that 20 other incidents of failed or broken variable pitch propellers were reported in subsequent months.",

                      "An armed Predator flew straight into a mountain at 17,000 feet because the pilot was not paying attention, according to an Air Force investigation report. The pilot was rushing to help troops on the ground but ignored warnings from other personnel to watch out for high mountains in the area. Investigators notified the pilot that he is suspected of dereliction of duty. The pilot says he was not warned about the high terrain and only became aware of it shortly before the crash when he looked up at his video screen and saw the mountain straight ahead. \"I knew, with the climbing capability of the Predator, you're not going to out-climb much, if anything,\" the major testified.",

                      "An armed Predator crashed after a pilot ignored repeated warnings from personnel that she was flying upside down. Crew members warned the pilot that an autopilot sensor had malfunctioned and that she needed to use a backup, manual sensor. According to investigators, the pilot thought the crew was joking when they warned her the Predator would fly upside down with the malfunctioning autopilot sensor. \"I didn't think, clearly understand, I guess, that when he said the plane will flip upside down, that he legitimately meant the plane would go out of control and point towards the ground,\" the pilot testified. When investigators asked her how well her training had prepared her for the incident, she replied: \"Um, I guess I'll just be blunt and say not well.\" The pilot was under suspicion for dereliction of duty.",

                      "A Predator crashed while attempting to land after a training mission. Investigators determined that a student pilot first flew too fast, then too slow as the aircraft descended during an attempted go-around landing. Difficult wind conditions were a contributing factor. The president of the Air Force's Accident Investigation Board, Lt. Col. Neil Neaderhiser, an experienced pilot, said Predators are especially difficult to handle. \"Of the eight aircraft types I have flown, from Cessna 152s to F-16s, the MQ-1 is by far the hardest to land.\"",

The pilot lost link and control of the aircraft soon after it started moving. According to investigators, a backup ground station \"hostilely\" took control of the aircraft because a crew member inadvertently turned on a transmitter. As a result, the throttle jumped from 0 to 70 percent. That crew member declined to testify. An instructor testified things could have been worse. \"If I had gone down back up through Gulf taxi way with what had happened here, the aircraft would have, at some point, would have been heading right towards the hangar where there are people, other aircraft and that type of thing,\" the instructor testified. \"It could have been a lot worse than a Pred stuck in a fence.\"",
                      "An armed Predator crashed immediately after takeoff. An investigator blamed pilot error, finding that the pilot forgot to turn on the Stability Augmentation System, which caused the drone to spin out of control.

                      "A brand-new Reaper crashed on private property in the California desert during a training mission. About two hours into the flight, the Reaper stalled after it slowed down too much and rolled left, entering into a spin before crashing onto the desert floor. Air Force investigators concluded that the cause was pilot error due to improper control of the aircraft's speed and angle. Investigators also found that the training program did not adequately prepare the pilot for risks associated with a slow flight. \"We were all in disbelief,\" a contractor who was in the ground-control station told investigators. \"We just didn't, I just didn't expect anything to happen on a fairly benign flight.\"",

Investigators concluded that the pilot inadvertently disabled the Predator's Stability Augmentation System, which keeps the aircraft from wobbling. The pilot was trying to turn off another switch in response to low coolant temperature but acknowledged in testimony that he pressed the \"big red button that says send the aircraft out of control.\" When he realized his mistake, he moved too quickly to reactivate the Stability Augmentation System when the aircraft was pitched down instead of waiting until the aircraft was straight and level. That made things worse, causing the Predator \"to aggressively pitch down further,\" according to the accident report.",

Investigators concluded that an alternator bearing failed, triggering a shutdown of the electrical system. According to voice recordings from the ground-control station, the pilot and sensor operator received warnings about the alternator but the aircraft soon lost link for about 85 seconds, signaling bigger problems. The crew said they were an hour flight from both Kandahar Air Base and Shindand Air Base and knew they couldn't reach either in time. \"We avoided -- attempted to avoid populated areas, stuff like that, so we were thinking, you know, if we were going to actually put this plane in the dirt, where do we not want to go, essentially,\" the pilot testified. \"And then eventually we just lost link with the airplane and never got it back.\"",
                      "An armed Predator crashed in the Gulf of Aden after its engine failed nine hours into a flight. Investigators concluded that cylinder malfunction and oil loss caused the engine failure but couldn't pinpoint the problem because the Predator sank in 150 feet of water and was not recovered. The drone's engine had been replaced one week earlier, but crews had to abort three other recent flights because of low oil pressure. Maintenance crews made a variety of repairs, and the aircraft flew a sortie on Jan. 13 without incident. \"It has a history of maintenance for engine problems, oil problems on that aircraft,\" the sensor operator testified. \"Without recovering the engine, we don't know exactly what happened.\"",
