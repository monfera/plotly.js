According to the crew, the engine stopped working and would only run at idle speed, so it rotated nose-down and starting falling from the sky. As the drone fell to an altitude of 3,000 feet, the pilot was ordered to fire the Hellfire missile into a sparsely populated area; he testified that he couldn't see exactly where it blew up. \"Normally when aircraft loss is probable and we are far away from our primary airfield the normal guidance is to go ahead and crash the plane into as many bits, as many small pieces as possible,\" a crew member testified. Ground forces later blew up much of the wreckage with C-4 explosives but recovered a few parts. Investigators concluded that the engine failed because something malfunctioned in the throttle body assembly, restricting air intake, but could not pinpoint the broken part."

Crew members complained about recurring mechanical problems. The doomed aircraft \"always kind of seemed to have a, we like to call them demons I guess,\" a staff sergeant testified. \"It's just one of those planes that seem to be broke a lot.

Investigators concluded that the pilot inadvertently disabled the Predator's Stability Augmentation System, which keeps the aircraft from wobbling. The pilot was trying to turn off another switch in response to low coolant temperature but acknowledged in testimony that he pressed the \"big red button that says send the aircraft out of control.\" When he realized his mistake, he moved too quickly to reactivate the Stability Augmentation System when the aircraft was pitched down instead of waiting until the aircraft was straight and level. That made things worse, causing the Predator \"to aggressively pitch down further,\" according to the accident report."

[expletive] It's spinning!\" the pilot said as his video screen went black. \"OK, I think it just fell out of the sky.\" Investigators determined that the aircraft plowed into terrain \"in a near-vertical trajectory\" after the failure of a circuit board computer chip on the secondary control module that controls the ruddervator.
